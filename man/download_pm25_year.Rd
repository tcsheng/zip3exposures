\title{Download Annual PM2.5 Monitoring Data (AirMonitor)}
\usage{
download_pm25_year(year)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Integer. The calendar year to download (e.g., `2017`).}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{date} — Date of observation.
  \item \code{state_fips}, \code{county_fips} — FIPS codes.
  \item \code{county_name}, \code{state_abbr} — Geographic descriptors.
  \item \code{pm25} — Daily average PM2.5 concentration (µg/m³).
}
}
\description{
This function retrieves daily PM2.5 measurements from the
\pkg{AirMonitor} database for an entire calendar year. The result
is returned as a tidy data frame with one row per monitor per day,
including metadata such as state, county, and FIPS codes.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{AirMonitor::airnow_loadAnnual()} to retrieve
monitor-level data and reshapes it into a long daily time series.
Only PM2.5 observations are retained.
