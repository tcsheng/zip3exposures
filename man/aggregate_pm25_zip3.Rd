\title{Aggregate County-Level PM2.5 Data to ZIP3 Regions}
\usage{
aggregate_pm25_zip3(pm25_county, crosswalk = zip3exposures::hud_zip3)
}
\arguments{
\item{crosswalk}{A tibble mapping ZIP3 codes to counties, containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{zip3} — ZIP3 region.
  \item \code{county_fips} — 5-digit FIPS code.
  \item \code{weight} — Population-based weight for aggregation.
}}

\item{county_pm25}{A tibble containing county-level PM2.5 time series
as returned by \code{download_pm25_year()}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with ZIP3-level PM2.5 by date:
\itemize{
  \item \code{zip3}
  \item \code{date}
  \item \code{pm25} — Weighted average PM2.5 for that ZIP3 and date.
}
}
\description{
This function converts county-level PM2.5 measurements into ZIP3-level
averages using a crosswalk file linking ZIP3 codes to county FIPS codes.
Each ZIP3's PM2.5 is computed as the population-weighted average of the
counties associated with that ZIP3.
}
\details{
The weights typically come from HUD USPS crosswalk population estimates
and ensure ZIP3-level values reflect population distribution across
counties.
